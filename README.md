### Title: Library Management System

Description:
Create a SQL database for a library management system that keeps track of books, borrowers, loans, and library branches. The project involves designing the schema, creating the tables, and implementing various queries and functionalities related to library operations.

Tables:

Books: This table should store information about the books available in the library such as book ID, title, author, ISBN, publication year, genre, etc.

Borrowers: This table should store information about the library patrons such as borrower ID, name, address, email, phone number, etc.

Loans: This table should store information about the loans made by borrowers such as loan ID, book ID, borrower ID, loan date, due date, return date, etc.

Library_Branches: This table should store information about the library branches such as branch ID, branch name, address, phone number, operating hours, etc.

Queries:

List all books available in a specific library branch.

Check the availability of a particular book in all library branches.

Display the books borrowed by a specific borrower.

Calculate the number of books borrowed by each borrower.

Identify overdue books and borrowers.

Find the most popular books based on the number of loans.

Update the due date for a loan.

Delete a borrower record and cascade the deletion to related loan records.

### Advanced Features (Optional):

Implement fine calculation for overdue books.

Add tables for storing book copies, authors, publishers, etc.

Implement reservation functionality for books.

Create stored procedures for common tasks (e.g., checking out a book, returning a book).

Implement indexing and optimize the database for performance.

This project will provide you with practical experience in designing a database schema for a specific domain and implementing various operations using SQL.
